## üß† How It Works

1. **Stock Data** is fetched from Yahoo Finance API (last 3 months).
2. A **custom trading environment** is built using OpenAI Gym.
3. A **Deep Q-Learning (DQN) model** is trained to make trading decisions.
4. The model learns an optimal policy to Buy, Sell, or Hold based on rewards.
5. The strategy is visualized with Buy (green arrow) and Sell (red arrow) points on the stock price chart.
